# Path Jump

A tiny cli tool to help you jump to the dir you want based on your history

### Installation

1. Go to [the latest release page](https://github.com/5c077m4n/path-jump/releases/latest) and download the right zip/tar file for you
1. Add files to `$PATH`
1. `cd` your way around
1. `p` your way to happyness!

### Usage

Just press `p` to jump to whatever directory you want:
- If you want to a relative path then append at the start `./`
- If you want to use one from your history the just press `p` followed by whatever you remember from the path

### TODO

- [ ] Add a dialog to show top relevant options
- [ ] Add custom commands
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Make a rusty api (publish crate?)
